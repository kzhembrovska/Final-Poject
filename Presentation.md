- What you did

I created an interactive illustration titled "//The Modern Creation of Adam" based on the painting 
"The Creation of Adam."
My inital goal coming into this class was to find a way to integrate technology with my drawings and paintings
to make them come to life/ animate them. 

Using a distance sensor, I made it so that the closer you are the brighter the multi colored "halo" 
lights would get and the hand of "God" would extend towards the viewer. There also is a surrounding cloth that 
"floats" on the top and sways lightly.


- How you did it

The "halo" componest was created with neoPixel LEDs. I sodered wires to create a connection to link all 10 LEDs. 
For the hand, I created a pully system by making a wheel with cardboard and then attaching it to the servo 
motor with screws. Then it was attached to a PVC pipe that was attached to the hand. I secured the sevo motor 
and PVC pipe to the board with 90 degree beams so that they would stay stable and secure. I created the movement
in the drapery by hot gluing small servo motors onto the board and attaching fishing line so that the viewer 
would see no string. I had to tie it to the tire attachment just right so that it wouldn't get tangled.

- What you learned along the way

...Exact measurements are crutial...box cutters are dangerous...make lots of prototypes to test things out, kind
of like how we do concept sketches in drawing/painting classes here, this is a 3D concept sketch...check work
often...

- What you would do differently

If I had more time I would render the painting way more to make it look moreso realistic and clean, aslo
I wish I had the time to add cherubs to the middle ground of the painting.
I would also find more fabric to make it more of a 3D effect with the drapery. 
In addition to this, I would also figure out a way to create an alternate material for the arm and reprint a
larger 3D hand.
I would also have liked to have more LEDs to really intensify the "halo" effect. If I had been given the access
to a linear actuato, I woudld have liked to try it insead of the servo motor.

links to tutorials or other websites you found helpful.

I think translating the smaller prototype into the larger one was one of the most challenging things, especially 
when dealing with the addition of the 90 degreee beam. I had a hard time attachiching it to the servo motor 
since I couldn't really see what was going on underneath. However, this was solved by finding large bobby pins
and poking through the bottom part to mark the holes where the screws were to go in. I almost don't think to
measure out where the beam goes and almost missed that in order for the pulley system and PVC pipe to work the 
beam needed to be on the side of the hole and lowered a bit. 

I struggled with perspective and value on the painting a lot. This was fixed though once I had reference and
researched different light sources and how they were used online. 

Another struggle was finding the proper components to work with. A lot of the sensors and servo motors in the 
hybrid lab are broken, glitchy, or just don't work alltogether. 

3D printing the hand was tricky. The 3D printing expert in the hybrid lab, Andy, worked very paitently with me
while I tried to find a file that would be accepted by the printer. It took about two weeks, communicating back
and forth, to find a file that would be acceptable. Everything was resolved when I found .obj file, except for
the fact that it was a left hand and I needed a right.

For some reason the Arduino uno board would not register with Adruino on my computer. This was really frustrating
thoguhout the entire project because I'm still not 100% sure how to fix it or why it happens.
